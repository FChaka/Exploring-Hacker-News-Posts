# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts

Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

For this project, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

Our aim is to determine:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
